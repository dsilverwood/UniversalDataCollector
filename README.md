# UniversalDataCollector
Data acquisition from multiple Raspberry Pi sensors using a Windows PC.
Create and configure sensors using this Windows application. Then upload the configuration to the Rasberry Pi.
Then, start the sensors and display the data in the Winform app. For now, only GPIO has been implemented and tested. The goal is to be able to create sensors that uses SPI, I2C, UART.

Navigation in the Windows application can be done with voice commands. To select a menu,simply read aloud the menu name. To select a button, simply read aloud the button label.
